#### Jellyfin: playCount vs viewCount

!!! tip "Understanding playCount vs viewCount"

    | Property    | What it counts                                |
    | ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
    | `viewCount` | Users who **completed** watching              |
    | `playCount` | Total **play attempts** (including abandoned) |

    **Example:** A movie has `PlayCount=2, Played=false` in Jellyfin:

    - `playCount = 2`
    - `viewCount = 0`

    **Useful Rule — Movies started but never finished:**

    ```
    playCount >= 1 AND viewCount = 0
    ```
